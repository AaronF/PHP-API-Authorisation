### PHP-API-Authorisation

An example of securing an API in PHP. I have included both the client side and the server side of things.

It based off of [this article](http://www.thebuzzmedia.com/designing-a-secure-rest-api-without-oauth-authentication/comment-page-1/#comment-572339)here which is well worth a read so you can get a good understanding of the flow.

Right now this is configured to be running in http://localhost/ so if you are running it anywhere else you will need to change the URL in both the client.php file and the server.php file (otherwise the internet might fall over).
